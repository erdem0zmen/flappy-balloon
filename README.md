// // Unity Learn Program's third Challenge Project was to fix a scene full of bugs. My goal was to fix the visible bugs and make it playable.

Challenge Overview: 
Applied my knowledge of physics, scrolling backgrounds, and special effects to a balloon floating through town, picking up tokens while avoiding explosives. 
Challenge Outcome:
The balloon floats upwards as the player holds spacebar
The background seamlessly repeats, simulating the balloon’s movement
Bombs and Money tokens are spawned randomly on a timer 
When you collide with the Money, there’s a particle and sound effect
When you collide with the Bomb, there’s an explosion and the background stops

Skills Practiced:
Debugging
Diagnose and fix code that compiles, but fails to perform as expected
Diagnose and fix common compilation errors
Diagnose and fix the cause of an exception
Application Scripting
Write code that utilizes the various Unity APIs
